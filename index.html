      <h2>Have excess inventory you want to sell?</h2>
      <p>
        We are always eager to purchase surplus, excess, and overstocked steel
        and metal. In addition to obsolete and over-ordered materials, we
        acquire products from canceled projects, including those stored
        outdoors, rusted, secondary, or distressed. We also buy discontinued
        inventory and off-spec materials that no longer meet production
        requirements. Our goal is to provide a hassle-free solution for clearing
        out unwanted metal while offering competitive prices.

      <p class="para-of-footer-line">
        Is excess or obsolete steel taking up valuable space in your warehouse?
        As inventory ages, its value declines, and finding trustworthy buyers
        can be difficult. However, you can recover some of that lost value by
        selling to wholesale buyers. Our team actively seeks surplus, aged, and
        obsolete steel and metal inventories. Offloading excess stock not only
        frees up space but also puts cash back into your business.
